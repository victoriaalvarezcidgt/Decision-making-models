DECISION MAKING MODELS

A decision-making model is a systematic approach or framework that helps individuals or organizations make effective and informed decisions. It provides a structured process to analyze a situation, consider alternatives, and choose the best course of action - in this case these models help financial institutions and lenders make informed decisions about whether to approve or deny credit applications, set appropriate credit limits, determine interest rates, and manage overall credit risk exposure.

Decision-making models can vary in complexity and details, but they generally involve the following key steps:
1. Identify the decision: Clearly define the problem or the decision that needs to be made. This step involves understanding the context, the objectives, and the desired outcomes.
2. Gather information: Collect relevant data, facts, and any other information that may be necessary for evaluating the options and making an informed decision. This could involve 
   research, analysis, and seeking input from experts or stakeholders.
3. Generate alternatives: Brainstorm and generate a range of possible solutions or alternatives to address the decision at hand. Encourage creativity and explore different perspectives to 
   ensure a comprehensive set of options.
4. Evaluate alternatives: Assess and compare the pros and cons of each alternative against the defined objectives and criteria. This may involve considering factors such as feasibility, 
   cost, risks, potential benefits, and ethical considerations.
5. Make a choice: Based on the evaluation, select the best alternative or combination of alternatives that aligns with the objectives and offers the most favorable outcome. This step may 
   involve prioritizing options, reaching a consensus, or making a judgment based on logical reasoning.
6. Implement the decision: Develop an action plan to execute the chosen alternative. Identify the required resources, assign responsibilities, and establish a timeline for implementation.
7. Review and learn: Monitor the implementation of the decision and evaluate its effectiveness. Assess whether the desired outcomes are being achieved and make any necessary adjustments or 
   improvements.

TOY EXAMPLE (explained like I am a 5 year old)
1. Imagine you have a bunch of toys and you want to pick one to play with --> A decision-making model is like a special way to help you choose the best toy.
2. First, you need to know what you want to decide. Let's say you want to decide which toy to play with --> this is the first step
3. Next, you gather information about the toys --> you look at each toy, touch them, and think about what you like about them
4. Then, you think of different toys you could play with --> maybe you have a car, a doll, and a puzzle (These are your alternatives)
5. After that, you compare the toys --> you think about which toy will make you the happiest (you really like puzzles, so you choose that one)
6. Once you've made your choice, you start playing with the puzzle (that's implementing your decision)
7. Finally, you see if you're having fun with the puzzle
	a. If you are, then it was a good decision
	b. If you're not enjoying it, maybe you'll try a different toy next time.
8. So, a decision-making model is like a step-by-step process to help you make good choices --> you think about what you want, look at your options, pick the best one, and see if it makes   
   you happy.

CREDIT RISK DECISION MAKING MODEL
A credit risk decision-making model is a method or framework that helps banks, financial institutions, or lenders assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and make informed decisions regarding lending or extending credit. It involves analyzing various factors and assigning a level of risk associated with granting credit to an individual or entity. These models use statistical techniques and predictive analytics to estimate the probability of default, evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers, and determine appropriate risk mitigation measures.

SIMPLIFED EXAMPLE (again cause Iâ€™m dumb)
1. Imagine you have a special tool that helps you decide if it's safe to lend money to someone --> this tool is called a credit risk decision-making model
2. To use this tool, you gather information about the person who wants to borrow money
	a. Past financial history
	b. If they have borrowed money before and paid it back on time
	c. Income
	d. Job stability
	e. Any other factors that might affect their ability to repay the loan.
3. Then, you enter all this information into the model --> the model uses a set of rules or calculations to analyze the data and give you a score or rating (tells you how risky it is to 
   lend money to that person)
4. Based on the score, you can decide whether to lend them money, how much to lend, and what interest rate to charge
	a. If the score is high, it means the person is more likely to repay the loan, so you might feel safer lending them money
	b. If the score is low, it means the person is less likely to replay the loan, so you might decide not to lend them money or charge a higher interest rate to protect yourself.
5. The credit risk decision-making model helps you make better decisions by providing a clear evaluation of the risk involved in lending money. It helps you protect your money and make 
   sure you are lending to people who are more likely to pay it back.
