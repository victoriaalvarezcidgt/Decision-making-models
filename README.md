<h3 align = "left"> What are Decision Making Models </h3>
  A decision-making model serves as a systematic framework, enabling individuals and organizations to navigate the complexities of making effective choices. By providing a structured process, it facilitates the analysis of various situations, careful 
  consideration of alternatives, and the identification of the optimal course of action. In the realm of financial institutions and lenders, these models play a pivotal role in enabling informed decisions concerning credit applications, setting appropriate 
  credit limits, determining interest rates, and managing overall credit risk exposure.

        <h4> Decision-Making Model Steps </h4>
    </summary>
<ul>
  <li> <strong> Identify the decision: </strong> Clearly define the problem or the decision that needs to be made. This step involves understanding the context, the objectives, and the desired
    outcomes. </li>
  <li> <strong> Gather information: </strong> Collect relevant data, facts, and any other information necessary for evaluating the options and making an informed decision. This
    could involve research, analysis, and seeking input from experts or stakeholders. </li>
  <li> <strong> Generate alternatives: </strong> Brainstorm and generate a range of possible solutions or alternatives to address the decision at hand. Encourage creativity and explore
    different perspectives to ensure a comprehensive set of options. </li>
  <li> <strong> Evaluate alternatives: </strong> Assess and compare the pros and cons of each alternative against the defined objectives and criteria. This may involve considering feasibility, cost, risks, potential benefits, and ethical considerations. </li>
  <li> <strong> Make a choice: </strong> Based on the evaluation, select the best alternative or combination of alternatives that align with the objectives and offers the most favourable
    outcome. This step may involve prioritizing options, reaching a consensus, or making a judgment based on logical reasoning. </li>
  <li> <strong> Implement the decision: </strong> Develop an action plan to execute the chosen alternative. Identify the required resources, assign responsibilities, and establish a timeline
    for implementation. </li>
  <li> <strong> Review and learn: </strong> Monitor the implementation of the decision and evaluate its effectiveness. Could you assess whether the desired outcomes are being achieved and make any
    necessary adjustments or improvements? </li>
</ul>

<h3 align = "left"> Credit Risk Decision Making Models </h3>
A credit risk decision-making model is an indispensable tool utilized by banks, financial institutions, and lenders to methodically assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and make well-informed lending decisions. By carefully analyzing a range of factors, 
these models assign a level of risk associated with granting credit to individuals or entities. Through the use of statistical techniques and predictive analytics, they estimate the probability of default, evaluate the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, 
and identify appropriate risk mitigation measures.
