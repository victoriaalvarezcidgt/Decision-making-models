<ul>
  <li>
    A decision-making model is a systematic approach or framework that helps individuals or organizations make effective and informed decisions. It provides a structured
    process to analyze a situation, consider alternatives, and choose the best course of action - in this case, these models help financial institutions and lenders 
    informed decisions about whether to approve or deny credit applications, set appropriate credit limits, determine interest rates, and manage overall credit risk exposure.

        Decision-Making Model Steps
    </summary>
<ul>
  <li> Identify the decision: Clearly define the problem or the decision that needs to be made. This step involves understanding the context, the objectives, and the desired
    outcomes. </li>
  <li> Gather information: Collect relevant data, facts, and any other information necessary for evaluating the options and making an informed decision. This
    could involve research, analysis, and seeking input from experts or stakeholders. </li>
  <li> Generate alternatives: Brainstorm and generate a range of possible solutions or alternatives to address the decision at hand. Encourage creativity and explore
    different perspectives to ensure a comprehensive set of options. </li>
  <li> Evaluate alternatives: Assess and compare the pros and cons of each alternative against the defined objectives and criteria. This may involve considering feasibility, cost, risks, potential benefits, and ethical considerations. </li>
  <li> Make a choice: Based on the evaluation, select the best alternative or combination of alternatives that align with the objectives and offers the most favourable
    outcome. This step may involve prioritizing options, reaching a consensus, or making a judgment based on logical reasoning. </li>
  <li> Implement the decision: Develop an action plan to execute the chosen alternative. Identify the required resources, assign responsibilities, and establish a timeline
    for implementation. </li>
  <li> Review and learn: Monitor the implementation of the decision and evaluate its effectiveness. Could you assess whether the desired outcomes are being achieved and make any
necessary adjustments or improvements? </li>

    A credit risk decision-making model is a method or framework that helps banks, financial institutions, or lenders assess the creditworthiness of borrowers and make
    informed decisions regarding lending or extending credit. It involves analyzing various factors and assigning a level of risk associated with granting credit to an
    individual or entity. These models use statistical techniques and predictive analytics to estimate the probability of default, evaluate the creditworthiness of
    borrowers, and determine appropriate risk mitigation measures.
